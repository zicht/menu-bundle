# 2.5.0 #

- Implemented new UriVoter to fix BC break issue in KnpMenuBundle 2.x where voters are used to determine active state. This is a backwards compatible fix whereas the voter is only used when 2.x of the KnpBundle is used.

# 2.3 #

- adds a command to rewrite public urls in the menu to internal urls ("unalias" them)
